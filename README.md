Foodiegram — HCI Website Prototype

Foodiegram is a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) website prototype designed to encourage food exploration through a social media–inspired interface. The project focuses on usability, navigation, and user engagement rather than backend functionality.

The website allows users to browse various food posts, explore recipes, rate dishes, and interact with content in a familiar social-feed layout. While there is no working database, the prototype demonstrates key user flows such as authentication, content posting, and bookmarking.
